<!--
    @SunburntRock89,
    The access to the file listings was disabled as Bob moved the site to dl.bobpony.com
    Automatically re-indexing the Downloads site was already being done by h5ai, then later nginx.
    This exists only as a tool for convenience of other users.

    By the way, thanks for removing jQuery. Would have done that myself later but I was lazy.

                    Note from Sep 5, 2020:
                    File listings were disabled due to issues.
                    Domain was also moved to dl.bobpony.com, which was fixed in the JS files, but not here.
                    Commented it out.
